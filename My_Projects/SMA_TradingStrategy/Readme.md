# SMA Trading Strategy Stock Filter with Backtest

The Simple Moving Average (SMA) trading strategy is a popular technical analysis approach used by traders and investors to identify trends and potential entry or exit points in the financial markets. The SMA is a commonly used indicator that smoothens price data to create a single flowing line, making it easier to identify the direction of the trend. Here's a basic overview of how the SMA trading strategy works:

1. **Calculation of SMA:**
   - Choose a specific time period (e.g., 50 days, 200 days) for which you want to calculate the SMA.
   - Add up the closing prices for the chosen period.
   - Divide the sum by the number of periods.

   The resulting value is the SMA, which is plotted on a price chart over time.

2. **Identification of Trends:**
   - When the current price is above the SMA, it suggests an uptrend.
   - When the current price is below the SMA, it suggests a downtrend.

3. **Entry Signals:**
   - **Golden Cross (Bullish Signal):** This occurs when a short-term SMA (e.g., 50-day) crosses above a long-term SMA (e.g., 200-day). It is considered a bullish signal and may indicate the start of an uptrend.
   - **Death Cross (Bearish Signal):** This happens when a short-term SMA crosses below a long-term SMA. It is considered a bearish signal and may indicate the start of a downtrend.

4. **Exit Signals:**
   - Traders may use crossovers in the opposite direction as exit signals. For example, if you are in a long position and the short-term SMA crosses below the long-term SMA, it could signal a potential trend reversal, prompting you to exit the trade.

5. **Risk Management:**
   - Traders often combine SMA crossovers with other technical indicators or tools to confirm signals and manage risks effectively.
   - It's essential to consider the overall market conditions, potential support and resistance levels, and other relevant factors when making trading decisions.

6. **Limitations:**
   - SMA reacts more slowly to price changes compared to other moving averages, such as Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs).
   - It may produce false signals during ranging or choppy market conditions.

Remember that no trading strategy guarantees success, and it's important to use risk management techniques, including setting stop-loss orders and having a clear understanding of the market conditions. Additionally, traders often customize SMA strategies based on their preferences and the specific assets they are trading.
